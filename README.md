# nanoAlt
This repo contains the open source hardware and software for [The Flame Trench](http://theflametrench)'s nanoAlt nano-scale rocketry altimeter family.

The project is not currently being prioritised, but we hope to be able to make nanoAlt Alpha available in kit form soon.

## nanoAlt Alpha
nanoAlt Alpha is the base version of the altimeter, using an ATTiny24A and simple barometer.  It is powered via 4.8mm coin cell, and reports altitude readings via flashing LED.  The software for nanoAlt Alpha is in an early state of development owing to the delays in finalising assembly for the boards, and is therefore unpublished at this time.  The nanoAlt Alpha boards expose a set of programming pins to allow custom programming of the microcontroller.

## nanoAlt Integrate
nanoAlt Integrate is a series of fittings designed to mount the nanoAlt family in a variety of common rocketry tube diameters.  Currently a BT-5 test piece is published, owing to the nanoAlt Alpha initially being designed for very small minimum diameter builds.
